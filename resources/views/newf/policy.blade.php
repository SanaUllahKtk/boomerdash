                    Offers more easily accessible, making the process of participating in Offers hassle-free, facilitating
                    your communications or transactions with them, authenticating and/or validating your identification,

                    where you see advertisements, which advertisements you interact with and how you interact with them, so
                    they may provide you with relevant Offers and advertisements that are of most interest to you. We are

                    Analytics to monitor how visitors use our website. Additionally, third-party analytics providers like
                    Google Analytics and others may use web browsing data and other data analysis to enhance their own

                <li><strong>Card Link Offers and Rewards.</strong> We may offer a Card Linked Offer program (a "CLO

                    you make qualifying transactions with participating merchants. If you participate in a CLO Program and
                    provide your payment information for that purpose, We and Third Party Services will have the right to
                    use and share the transaction information generated in such CLO Program (“CLO Transaction Data”) for the

                    qualify for an Offer; to affirm whether a particular Offer has been redeemed and apply necessary earned

                    Program and its Offers; to make and maintain a record of the CLO transaction data for operation
                    purposes; to respond to a request from a government agency or a payment processor involved in a
                    transaction with you, a third party merchant, or other Trusted Third Party. By taking part in a CLO
                    Program, you authorize the sharing, exchange, and utilization of CLO Transaction Data as described
                    herein by us and Trusted Third Party Services, payment processors and participating third party
                    merchants. Please visit the card linking section of the relevant Service and delete any payment cards
                    that you no longer wish to be associated with the CLO Program in order to opt out of card linking and
                    CLO Transaction Data collection in connection with a CLO Program.</li>

                    hashtag associated with any of our Services in a tweet or status update). Additionally, if other Social

                    also obtain information about you from those profiles. Likewise, if your connections have websites,

                    obtain information about you from those websites. This Privacy Policy applies to the data we gather in
                    conjunction with social features. Any Social Media Service that collects information via Social Features
                    does so in accordance with its own privacy policies, including whether it continues to share information
                    with us, the categories of information shared, and your choices regarding what is publicly available on

                    your data specified throughout this Privacy Policy. When required by law, or in the event that we have a
                    legitimate belief that doing so is necessary to abide with a court order, a criminal investigation, a
                    court order, or other legal process issued on us, we may share your Personal Identifiable Information
                    and non Personal Identifiable Information. Additionally, if governmental authorities ask us to do so in
                    the course of an investigation or if we determine, in our sole discretion, that there is a credible
                    reason to do so in order to investigate, stop, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected
                    fraud or abuse, or circumstances involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or
                    violations of our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy for any of the Pro Prospecting Sites, Features or our
                    Services. We may also use IP addresses, device identifiers, or other session identifiers to identify
                    users in conjunction with Third Party Services, copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless

                    do so without notifying you. Additionally, for our data purposes and in connection with their provision
                    of services to, or on behalf of, Pro Prospecting Sites, Features or our Services, we may also share your
                    Personal Identifiable Information with Third Party Services. Additionally, if you use our mobile
                    applications, we could share your geolocation to Third Party Services in order for us or they to present
                    to you Offers depending on your location, for our Data Purposes, and for advertising, attribution,
                    measurement of campaigns, analytics and research. We may share or sell aggregate or personalized data
                    about you, such as, but not limited to: (1) your Personal Identifiable Information and related data; (2)
                    your use of Pro Prospecting Sites, Features and our Services; (3) Third Party Services and other

                    data purposes.</li>

            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and
                technical security measures.</p>

            <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to
                protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
                secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can
                be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
                unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
                modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
                personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services

                years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
                delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under

            <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about

                information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance,
                depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can
                match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you
                through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also
                use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>

            <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make
                the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
                purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained
                by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity
                and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon
                as we finish verifying you.</p>

            <h2>Financial Incentives</h2>

            <p>"Financial incentive" means a program, benefit, or other offering, including payments to consumers as
                compensation, for the disclosure, deletion, sale, or sharing of personal information.</p>

            <p>The law permits financial incentives or a price or service difference if it is reasonably related to the
                value of the consumer’s data. A business must be able to explain how the financial incentive or price or
                service difference is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data. The explanation must include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>a good-faith estimate of the value of the consumer’s data that forms the basis for offering the
                    financial incentive or price or service difference;</li>
                <li>a description of the method the business used to calculate the value of the consumer’s data.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We may decide to offer a financial incentive (e.g., price or service difference) in exchange for the
                retention, sale, or sharing of a consumer’s personal information.</p>

            <p>If we decide to offer a financial incentive, we will notify you of such financial incentive and explain the
                price difference, as well as material terms of the financial incentive or price of service difference,
                including the categories of personal information that are implicated by the financial incentive or price or
                service difference.</p>

            <p>If you choose to participate in the financial incentive you can withdraw from the financial incentive at any
                time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@proprospecting.org">privacy@proprospecting.org</a>, by
                visiting <a href="https://proprospecting.org/?page_id=325">our website</a>, or by referring to the contact
